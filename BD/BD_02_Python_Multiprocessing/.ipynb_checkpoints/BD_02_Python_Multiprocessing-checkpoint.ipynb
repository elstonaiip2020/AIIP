    "# Introduction to parallel programming with python\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously discussed parallel computing involves solving the same problem with 1 or more cpu cores or even more than one computers. Parallel solutions mostly involve sub tasks that are able to run independently of each other with very little or no communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "In python the two common approaches to parallel programming are running code with multiple threads or multiple processes. The main difference between the terms is that threads are a part of a process, that is a process may contain one or more threads, but a thread cannot contain a process. Read more on the differences [here](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/whats-the-diff-programs-processes-and-threads/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Threads from the reading have shared memory while processes have completely memory locations (distributed memory). Using threads can easily lead to to race conditions when data access isn't synchronized, this where a multiple threads try to read/write to the same memory location. Depending on the relative speeds of the threads the results for the same operation could differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](http://twimgs.com/ddj/images/article/2011/0611/thread.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "With the above example the final value of x can be 1,2,3 depending how the threads run.\n",
    "\n",
    "A safer approach is to run multiple process where each will run its own memory space. The trade off here is the communication overhead between separate process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason why processes may be a better option over threads is python's GIL (Global Interpreter Lock). In order to prevent conflicts between threads python implements a locking mechanism that prevents multiple threads from executing python bytecode at once.The reason for this is beyond this course but for the curious souls read more [here](https://realpython.com/python-gil/)\n"
