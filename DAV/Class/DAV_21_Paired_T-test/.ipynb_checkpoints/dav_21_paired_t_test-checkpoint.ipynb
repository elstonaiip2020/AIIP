    "Researchers conducted a random trial on the treatment of [fibromyalgia](http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa0912611). Fibromyalgia is a condition where the body suffers from chronic, localized pain and as a result affects a sufferer's psyche among many other symptoms. There is no cure for fibromyalgia except to manage the pain. We obtained a dataset that has 50 observations and 11 variables. The variables are sex, BMI, duration of treatement, age, treatment,\tcoexists i.e. other health issues, FIQ_baseline, FIQ_12W, and FIQ_24W scores. Treatment is measured using the severity of the symptoms immediately before the treatment was started (FIQ-baseline) and after 12 weeks of treatment (FIQ-12W) and 24 weeks of treatment (FIQ-24W). Let us look to see if the tai chi treatment relieves pain after 12 weeks. That is, we want to determine if there is a difference in pain severity given the tai chi treatment. "
